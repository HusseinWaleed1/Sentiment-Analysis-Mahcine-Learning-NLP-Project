# Sentiment Analysis Web Application 💬🤖

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end **Sentiment Analysis Web Application** built using **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Flask**. The application analyzes text input and classifies it into sentiment categories such as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

The project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment as a web application.
